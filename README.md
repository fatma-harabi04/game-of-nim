# game-of-nim
A classic stone-removal strategy game (Nim) where two players take turns removing 1 or 2 stones. The player forced to take the last stone loses.
#  Game of Nim (Two-Player Version)

This is a simple command-line implementation of the **Game of Nim**, a classic mathematical strategy game for two players.

##  How to Play

- The game starts with a pile of stones (default: 10).
- Two players take turns.
- On each turn, a player must remove **1 or 2 stones**.
- The player who removes the **last stone loses**.

> Note: This version follows the *misère* variant of Nim, where taking the last stone means **you lose**.

##  Strategy Tip

Always try to leave a multiple of **3** for your opponent.
